############################################################################

Format the first line of this file to give the desired output:

e.g.

The currently playing track is: {title} by {artist} from {album}

  will result in:

The currently playing track is: The Title of The Song by The Artist from The Album

  where the text "The Title of The Song", "The Artist" and "The Album"
  were read from Rhythmbox's database.

Properties read from Rhythmbox's Database:
	
	bpm
	year
	title
	album
	genre
	rating
	artist
	comment
	summary
	bitrate
	subtitle
	composer
	disc_num
	copyright
	track_num
	media_type
	play_count
	discs_total
	description
	album_artist
	track_length
	tracks_total
	
	The following two properties contain the same data, formatted differently:
		
		last_played
		last_played_str
		
	Also use custom properties from "custom-props.txt"

All the standard properties and their values in one line (for convenience):
	
		bpm={bpm}, year={year}, title={title}, album={album}, genre={genre}, rating={rating}, artist={artist}, comment={comment}, summary={summary}, bitrate={bitrate}, subtitle={subtitle}, composer={composer}, disc_num={disc_num}, copyright={copyright}, track_num={track_num}, media_type={media_type}, play_count={play_count}, discs_total={discs_total}, last_played={last_played}, description={description}, album_artist={album_artist}, track_length={track_length}, tracks_total={tracks_total}, last_played_str={last_played_str}
