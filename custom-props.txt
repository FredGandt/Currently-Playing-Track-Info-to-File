# Custom properties for output formatting.
## Properties defined here may be used in the .txt formatting file for convenience.

## Names MUST be unique; "custom_" will be automatically prepended to the names, but
## the properties MUST be fully named (including the leading "custom_") when used in
## the "format.txt" file.

## The syntax for a custom properties defined in this file is (excluding the "### "):
### property_name=Property Value

## Values will be interpreted as text (even if they're numbers or symbols).

## Depending on many intricate variables, some less than standard characters may be used.
### The following site, for example, lists a block of unicode characters,
### that allow italics (amongst other things) to be added to the output.
